When healthcare enterprises choose to participate in NHSN, they must report to CDC occurrences such as specific reportable procedures, even those without complications, and events such as a bloodstream infection, either confirmed by a positive blood culture or supported by a patients clinical symptoms. This specification opens the channel for data submission by all applications compliant with the data coding requirements defined here.\n\nNote that participation in the NHSN requires enrollment and filing of reporting plans, which are not defined by this specification. For an overview of NHSN and full information on NHSN participation requirements, see: [http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn](http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn).

Additional content could potentially be added in a later effort.\n\n***Related information flows outside of consumer RTPBC*** <br/>\nThe patient application might gather related information before submitting the consumer RTPBC request, such as prescription information or insurance eligibility. *These exchanges are outside the scope of this guide.*\n\n<br>\n\n### Feedback\nThis implementation guide is the result of work sponsored by the CARIN Alliance, whose goal is to advance the ability for consumers and their authorized caregivers to easily get, use, and share their digital health information when, where, and how they want to achieve their goals.\n\nComments and suggestions are welcome on our Zulip stream...\nhttps://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/208660-CARIN-Benefit.20Check.20IG\n\n* or send a note to fm@frankmckinney.com\n\n<br/>\n\n### Change log\n\n**0.1.10 (This version):** Added proposed coupon representation in Coverage resource (when request is processed by a discount pricing source). Added currency, state and country value set values in ClaimResponse, Patient and pharmacy Organization profiles.\n\n**0.1.09:** Added message definitions for the request and response. Added an Error Handling section in the Guidance menu, and placeholder 'error code' CodeSystem and ValueSet resources (to be refined/replaced after stakeholder discussion).\n\n**0.1.08:** Added discussion of submission/response using FHIR messaging to the Submission Method page (renamed from Submit Operation). Added examples of submission / response using messaging. Added an extension (isAlternative) to characterize ClaimResponse.addItem composites as independent alternative fulfillment options (based on feedback from the FM WG). Added a Security page under Guidance, to be further fleshed out through stakeholder discussion.\n\n**0.1.07:** Moved content illustration content to Examples section. (Changed name of Other menu item to Examples). Adjusted Submit Operation to remove the MessageHeader resource from the submitted Bundle, based on discussion with Financial Mgmt WG. Likewise adjusted the Bundle examples and illustrations. Clarified the high-level resource map illustration to match current approach. \n\n**0.1.06:** Added the Coverage resource into the request content illustration (inadvertently left it out earlier).\n\n**0.1.05:** Added MedicationRequest.reported as a Must Support element to indicate whether the prescription information is being reported by the patient or other source (versus being the actual original prescription resource). Added content illustrations to provide business-level discussion material.\n\n**0.1.04:** Addressed broken page links, made small profile adjustments in ClaimResponse.\n\n**0.1.03:** Added submit operation and parameter details. Added bundled version of request and response. Corrected version using Claim w/contained resources (for discussion). Added separate Patient, Coverage, MedicationRequest, Organization, MessageHeader example resources.\n\n**0.1.02 :** Loosened element cardinality restrictions in the Claim profile based on input from reviewers. General narrative cleanup.\n\n**0.1.01:** Adjusted background and use case material to also reflect RTPBC communication between the patient's application and discount medication pricing sources--which augments information retrieved from the patient's insurer. In process of reorganizing content to a more intuitive arrangement. \n\n**0.1.00:** Initial resources and narrative content.\n\n<br/>\n\n### Known issues and to-dos\n* The example, rtpbc-claim-with-contained-03, omits the MedicationRequest; it is being lost when importing the resource to Trifolia. Trying to figure out...\n\n\n<br/> (built Fri, Dec 20, 2019 01:48+0000+00:00)"

Inpatient hypoglycemia can be severe and life-threatening and is associated with longer hospital stays and increased medical costs. Severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL) occurs in 2%-5% of hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).

Hypoglycemia Module provides a mechanism for facilities to report and analyze medication-related hypoglycemia as part of patient safety and glycemic management quality improvement efforts.\n\nThe measures planned for used in this module are based on quality reporting metrics previously- or currently-endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF): NQF #2363 Glycemic Control - Hypoglycemia and NQF #3503 Hospital Harm ? Severe Hypoglycemia. The metrics reported in this module would be primarily based on linked eMAR (antidiabetic medication administration) and laboratory (blood glucose) data. These long-standing linkages links between public health and vendors can be leveraged in ways that yield benefits for surveillance and prevention that are tightly coupled to business models and growth.

        "description": "Adverse drug events (ADEs) are among the most common causes of iatrogenic harm in U.S. hospitals. An effort to establish an EHR- and vendor-neutral standard for submitting ADE data to NHSN is being sought to improve patient safety and facilitate quality improvement effort. This promising initiative seeks to enable EHRs of acute care facilities to serve as source systems for reporting ADE data to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) via industry electronic messages. This initiative leverages NHSN?s longstanding experience working closely with the Health Level Seven (HL7) standards development organization and HL7 consultants in developing and maintaining electronic healthcare-associated and antibiotic use and resistance reporting implementation guidance for EHRs and infection surveillance system vendors in the acute care arena. That experience, and the working relationships developed over a 10-year partnership, are an important foundation for a collaborative effort in which NHSN, HL7, HL7 consultants, and EHR vendors join forces to advance the field of electronic ADE reporting.\n\nThis first module, Hypoglycemia, planned for the NHSN Medication Safety Component, would enable hospitals to track and benchmark inpatient medication-related hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Inpatient hypoglycemia can be severe and life-threatening and is associated with longer hospital stays and increased medical costs. Severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL) occurs in 2%-5% of hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Medication-related hypoglycemic events are common causes of adverse drug events (ADEs) occurring in inpatient settings, with rates of severe hypoglycemia varying across hospitals, suggesting opportunities for improvement in the quality of care.

It is informed by:\n* [HL7, Version 2.6 Implementation Guide: Vital Records Birth and Fetal Death Reporting, Release 1,STU Release 2.1 - US Realm (April 2020)](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=320)\n* [HL7, CDA� R2 Implementation Guide: Birth and Fetal Death Reporting, Release 1, STU Release 2 - US Realm (June 2019)](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=387)\n* [HL7, Vital Records Mortality and Morbidity Reporting (VRDR) FHIR Implementation Guide 1.0.0,  STU 1 (October 2020)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vrdr/)\n* [IHE , Quality, Research and Public Health Technical Framework Supplement - Birth and Fetal Death Reporting-Enhanced (BFDR-E) (September 2018)](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_BFDR-E.pdf)\n* [ONC, United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) (April 2020)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi)\n\n### Dependencies\nThis implementation guide re-uses profiles from the following guides:\n* [Vital Records Common Profiles Library](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vr-common-library)\n* [US Core Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core)\n\n### Audience\nThis guide is for analysts and developers who require guidance on the use of the HL7 FHIR for providing birth and fetal death reporting information. The implementation guide is informative to health care provider organizations, jurisdictional Vital Records Offices, CDC/NCHS, health information exchange organizations, and other vital records fetal death reporting stakeholders.\n\n### Background \nThis FHIR implementation guide builds on previous electronic data standards for transmitting vital records of death, birth, and fetal death. The goal has been to transmit reliable and relevant clinical information to jurisdictional Vital Records Offices and to transfer information from Vital Records Offices to the national statistics agency. \n\nElectronic vital records work started with the HL7 Vital Records Domain Analysis Model (VR DAM), published as an Informative Specification in 2011. The VR DAM was updated in 2017 with the HL7 Cross-Paradigm Domain Analysis Model: Vital Records, Release 2, in 2018, with Release 3, and in November 2020 as Release 4.\n\nThis FHIR implementation guide uses the US Core profiles. Where this FHIR implementation guide is unable to use a US Core profile, we have followed the Cross Group Projects WG's variance request process, and have provided the US Realm Steering Committee an approved rationale for deviation in the implementation guide.\n\n### How to Read This Guide\n\nThis Guide is divided into several pages which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar.\n\n* Home: The home page provides the introduction and background for HL7 FHIR� Vital Records Common Profiles Library.\n* Use Cases: This page details the use cases supported by this guide.\n* Implementer Guidance: This page details the worksheet Questionnaire format and the relationship to the IHE specification.\n* Terminology: This page provides a listing of the value sets used in this guide.\n* Downloads: This page provides links to downloadable artifacts.\n* Artifact Index: This page provides a list of the FHIR artifacts (profiles, examples, and value sets) defined as part of this guide.\n* Appendices: This pages provides examples of live birth and fetal death reports and worksheets.\n\n### Author\n\n[HL7 International - Public Health](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/pher)\n\n### Other Information\n\nThis is the first FHIR BFDR standard.\n\nThis guide is compliant with FHIR Release 4.\n\nFor Clinical Safety Information please refer to the [FHIR Implementer?s Safety Checklist](http://hl7.org/fhir/safety.html).\n\nDisclaimer: All proprietary documents, guides, guidance, standards, codes, and values contained herein remain the property of their respective Standards Developing Organization (SDO).

    "description": "### Scope\nThe Longitudinal Maternal & Child Health Information for Research FHIR R4 implementation guide (IG) defines a framework to enable maternal health researchers to aggregate, calculate, and analyze clinical information of research populations to explore the root causes for maternal and child morbidity and mortality. It uses Clinical Quality Language (CQL) expressions to assist researchers in capturing clinical data based on population study cohort criteria. This IG focuses on information relevant to longitudinal maternal care, which includes antepartum (including pre-pregnancy), intrapartum, and postpartum care of a pregnant woman. It includes how to link maternal longitudinal record with associated child/children records. \n\nThis US Realm IG supports the use of US Core profiles where possible, as well as base FHIR and Vital Records Common Profiles FHIR IG data model for the structural linkage of mother and child clinical records. \n\n\n### Background\nThe rates of maternal mortality have been rising in the United States since 1987. Clinical data relevant to understanding this trend are not standardized, and data exchange is not interoperable across many relevant settings. Maternal health and associated child health are inextricably linked ? what happens during gestation, delivery, and after informs health outcomes of both mother and child ? but relevant data is often held in separate, unconnected records. These issues impede research on maternal morbidity and longitudinal maternal care and associated impacts to infant health. Research on root causes of maternal mortality, pediatric developmental problems, and effective treatments requires exchange of information stored in disparate sources, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems, registries, and public health agencies (PHAs).\n\nThe types of information needed to research maternal health and morbidity include social determinants of health (SDOH) and associated clinical data such as antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care of a pregnant woman; pregnancy-related conditions and outcomes; maternal co-morbidities; child health data; and procedures. The goal of this FHIR IG is to define a model to support data exchange for predictive analysis, risk assessment, and retrospective maternal health research across the spectrum and duration of care. \n\nFuture users may include health departments using EHR data to inform public health interventions (e.g., case identification for reportable conditions, identifying persons lost to care, etc.) and maternal and child health researchers. The standards development effort will also examine options for data exchange mechanisms, including point-in-time query (data pull) and research population creation, i.e., patient enrollment in a study.\n\n### Maternal Research Use Cases\n\nThis IG will eventually support mapping maternal data across health records from specialty care and linking mother and child data harmonized across a broad set of use cases. This will support researchers in identifying root causes of maternal mortality and pediatric developmental problems, including SDOH such as limited income, poor nutrition, lack of medical coverage, etc. The goal of the project is to create a method to standardize data capture for comparative analysis over time to improve health outcomes and define a framework for studying additional research populations in the future.\n\nInitial use cases of this IG focus on pregnancy and subsequent death within a specific timeframe and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy pre, ante, and postpartum. The intent is to specify the consistent capture of clinical data of interest to maternal health researchers and outline implementing FHIR resources for that capture. Currently, the IG defines two initial research use case populations: \n\n* Pregnancy and subsequent death within a specific time frame: This cohort includes women who died within a year (365 days) of a pregnancy regardless of cause of death or pregnancy outcome.\n* Hypertensive Disorders of pregnancy: This use case focuses on women with a diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.\n\nIn both instances, the IG will establish linkages via the US Core Related Person profile to collect associated child health data that may inform maternal health research outcomes. \n\nIn the future, the IG will expand this framework to a range of use cases including:\n* Risks for children related to maternal exposure to medications taken during pregnancy\n* Potential adverse maternal obstetric history impacts on child outcomes\n* Access to relevant sensitive health information\n* Retrospective population-based analysis of inherited disorders\n\nThis guide fundamentally relies on creating structural relationships between:\n* Maternal and child records to effectively diagnose and treat otherwise fatal child outcomes\n* Maternal and birth records and/or maternal and child death records\n* Maternal and child records in multiple disparate systems\n\n### Audience \nThe audience for this IG includes EHR vendors, developers of software tooling researchers, and associated information management systems. Researchers, business analysts, and policy managers can also benefit from a basic understanding of the use of this guide to support measure calculation for research purposes.\n\n### Authors & Project Team\nThis table lists the authors, subject matter experts, and the affiliations which contributed to this standard. \n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-4erg{border-color:inherit;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0r4h{border-color:inherit;font-family:serif !important;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-fymr\">Name &amp;

Research on root causes of maternal mortality, pediatric developmental problems, and effective treatments requires exchange of information stored in disparate sources, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems, registries, and public health agencies (PHAs).\n\nThe types of information needed to research maternal health and morbidity include social determinants of health (SDOH) and associated clinical data such as antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care of a pregnant woman; pregnancy-related conditions and outcomes; maternal co-morbidities; child health data; and procedures. The goal of this FHIR IG is to define a model to support data exchange for predictive analysis, risk assessment, and retrospective maternal health research across the spectrum and duration of care. \n\nFuture users may include health departments using EHR data to inform public health interventions (e.g., case identification for reportable conditions, identifying persons lost to care, etc.) and maternal and child health researchers. The standards development effort will also examine options for data exchange mechanisms, including point-in-time query (data pull) and research population creation, i.e., patient enrollment in a study.\n\n### Maternal Research Use Cases\n\nThis IG will eventually support mapping maternal data across health records from specialty care and linking mother and child data harmonized across a broad set of use cases. This will support researchers in identifying root causes of maternal mortality and pediatric developmental problems, including SDOH such as limited income, poor nutrition, lack of medical coverage, etc. The goal of the project is to create a method to standardize data capture for comparative analysis over time to improve health outcomes and define a framework for studying additional research populations in the future.\n\nInitial use cases of this IG focus on pregnancy and subsequent death within a specific timeframe and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy pre, ante, and postpartum. The intent is to specify the consistent capture of clinical data of interest to maternal health researchers and outline implementing FHIR resources for that capture. Currently, the IG defines two initial research use case populations: \n\n* Pregnancy and subsequent death within a specific time frame: This cohort includes women who died within a year (365 days) of a pregnancy regardless of cause of death or pregnancy outcome.\n* Hypertensive Disorders of pregnancy: This use case focuses on women with a diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.\n\nIn both instances, the IG will establish linkages via the US Core Related Person profile to collect associated child health data that may inform maternal health research outcomes. \n\nIn the future, the IG will expand this framework to a range of use cases including:\n* Risks for children related to maternal exposure to medications taken during pregnancy\n* Potential adverse maternal obstetric history impacts on child outcomes\n* Access to relevant sensitive health information\n* Retrospective population-based analysis of inherited disorders\n\nThis guide fundamentally relies on creating structural relationships between:\n* Maternal and child records to effectively diagnose and treat otherwise fatal child outcomes\n* Maternal and birth records and/or maternal and child death records\n* Maternal and child records in multiple disparate systems\n\n### Audience \nThe audience for this IG includes EHR vendors, developers of software tooling researchers, and associated information management systems. Researchers, business analysts, and policy managers can also benefit from a basic understanding of the use of this guide to support measure calculation for research purposes.\n\n### Authors & Project Team\nThis table lists the authors, subject matter experts, and the affiliations which contributed to this standard. \n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-4erg{border-color:inherit;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0r4h{border-color:inherit;font-family:serif !important;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-fymr\">Name &amp;

        "description": "# CARIN Alliance\n**_Enabling consumers and their authorized caregivers to access more of their digital health information with less friction._**\n\nThis implementation guide describes the CARIN Blue Button&reg; Framework and Common Payer Consumer Data Set (CPCDS), providing a set of resources that payers can display to consumers via a FHIR API.\n\nSee the [Table of Contents](toc.html) for more information.\n\n---\n\n---\n### Latest Changes\n\n\n| Number | Description |\n| :---: | --- |\n| 60 | Added Balloter Notes to document the errors in QA.html and explain that these errors have been reviewed and were considered acceptable for going to ballot. |\n| 59 | A new html page was added to the IG to fix the broken Directory of Published version link which wasn't working because this is the first version of the IG to be published. |\n| 58 | The Request a Change link in the IG footer was fixed in Trifolia to take commenters to the new HL7 Jira site for tracking issues. |\n| 57 | Examples have been added and referenced from a new Examples Section. Additional examples will be developed and reviewed during the ballot reconciliation period to be included with the published IG. |\n| 56 | Search Parameters: Added a Search Parameters page to expose the developed SearchParameter Resources defined in this IG. A note to balloters was added to explain that Trifolia on FHIR is not rendering SearchParameter Resources correctly and reviewers need to use the XML or JSON tab to see the defintion. |\n| 55 | Notes to Balloters: A note to balloters was added to explain that the name of the IG has been changed. The formal HL7 title does not include the FHIR Accelerator Program name, nor does it use of a trademarked phrase. An acknowledgement was added to explain the IG will also be known as (aka) the Carin Blue Button IG. |\n| 54 | Notes to Balloters: A note to balloters was added to explain that certain Terminology naming issues will be addressed during the ballot process and will be resolved prior to publication in the following way: the Value Sets will be updated to remove reference to CARIN Blue Button, replaced by either industry standard names or, for those specific to claim adjudication, with the new IG name.  Industry standard Code System revisions include consolidating the three Type of Bill Codes, removing reference to SNOMED CT, etc. Some value sets renaming has be started. The rest will be completed during ballot reconciliation. |\n| 53 | Note to Balloters: A note to balloters was added to explain that certain Code System referencing issues will be addressed during the ballot process and will be resolved prior to publication. Based on recent guidance from the HL7 Vocabulary Workgroup a change will be made to reference external licensed Code Systems using URIs instead of OIDs|\n| 52 | Capability Statements: The names of the Capability Statements were modified to align with the updated actor names. |\n| 51 | Profiles and Extensions: The MustSupport implementer guidance was added to the CARINBBExplanationOfBenefit Profile.  A sentence was added to explain the Explanation of Benefit profiles inherit MustSupport guidance from the base profile.  Search parameter guidance was added for the Coverage and Explanation of Benefit profile.  |\n| 50 | Notes to Balloters: The Feedback section was modified to Notes to Balloters and comments were added requesting feedback on additional search parameters needed to support the use cases covered in this IG. An additional comment was added about Value Set and Codes System names noting they will be updated prior to publication and Terminology references. The note explains that they way Licensed Codes Systems and associated Value Sets are identified will be modified to incorporate recent changes in the way FHIR IGs specify external codes systems that HL7 is not licensed to incorporate into publications made available through HL7.org/FHIR \n|\n| 49 | Access to Licensed Code Systems: A new section under General Guidance, Access to Licensed Code Systems, was added.  It will include guidance on how to access Licensed Industry Standard Code Systems and Available Industry Standard Code Systems. |\n| 48 | General Guidance: A section, General Guidance, was added to include guidance to support MustSupport for this IG, how to handle missing information. |\n| 47 | Use Case: A sequence flow diagram was added and the actor names in the descriptions were modified to align with the actor names used in the diagram. |\n| 46 | CARIN Blue Button Framework Specification: hotlinks were added to make the content it describes directly accessible without having to click through next page. |\n| 45 | Home Page, CARIN Alliance section: Formatting was resolved and additional verbiage was added to note that Blue Button is a registered mark of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. An attribution statement was made in the Acknowledgements to state, Blue Button, the slogan, Download My Data, the Blue Button Logo, and the Blue Button combined logo are registered service marks owned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. |\n| 44 | Refined mapping page and added worksheet download link. Added initial profile desciptions and  must support flags. |\n| 43 | The IG does not forbid any elements from base R4. Added &reg; symbol to Blue Button references to acknowledge CMS' registered mark. Reorganized the mapping sections. |\n| 42 | First pass at harmonization of profiles and terminologies. Added the **Authorization, Authentication, and Registration** section. |\n| 41 | set content to completed for code system [CARINBBClaimType](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin/CodeSystem/carin-bb-claim-type) |\n| 40 |  Binding of value set [CARINBBClaimType](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin/ValueSet/carin-bb-claim-type) to eob.type in profile [CARINBBExplanationOfBenefit](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin/StructureDefinition/carin-bb-explanationofbenefit) |\n| 39 |  Added new code allowedunits to [CARINBBAdjudicationCategory](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin/CodeSystem/carin-bb-adjudicationcategory) |\n| 38 |  Added new code clmlastactiondate to [CARINBBClaimInformationCategory](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin/CodeSystem/carin-bb-claiminformationcategory) |\n| 37 | Updated Feedback section with Zulip stream information |\n| 36 | Added explicit \"draft\" verbiage |\n| 35 | Revised narrative content |\n| 34 | Removed Credits and added USCore Patient based CARINBBPatient profile |\n| 33 | Removed mapping page content and created new pages for Coverage, Patient, Comprehensive, and Data Index (to match spreadsheet); added content from spreadsheet to the pages |\n| 32 | Added 4 specific EOB and 1 Coverage profiles. |\n| 31 | Removed mapping pages for Claim, Claim LIne, Diagnosis, Procedure, Member and Coverage; removed 10 EOB profile stubs and replaced with 1 base profile |\n| 30 | Added pages to hold mappings for EOB Inpatient Facility, EOB Outpatient Facility, EOB Professional/Non-Clinician, and EOB Pharmacy |\n| 29 | Updated Provider and Claim Line Amounts mappings. |\n| 28 | Removed references to flat file format.  Combined CPCDS format and mapping sections. Updated sample reverse mapping. |\n| 27 | Replaced 6 EOB profiles (one per claim type) with 10 EOB profiles (one per claim/subclaim type, flattened). Renamed things with new naming convention. |\n| 26 | Added sample of reverse mapping narrative for ExplanationOfBenefit. |\n| 25 | Added FHIR Resources section to narrative and included Example EOB. |\n| 24 | Replaced EOB profile with one EOB profile for each claim type. Added Business Rules page as a placeholder. |\n| 23 | Added the Latest Changes section. Added USCoreR4 Dependency. |\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe Consumer-Directed Payer Data Exchange Implementation Guide is also known as the CARIN Blue Button&reg; Implementation Guide.\n\nBlue Button, the slogan, 'Download My Data,' the Blue Button Logo, and the Blue Button combined logo are registered service marks owned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n---\n>This implementation guide is currently a work in progress and is in draft status.\n>\n>Blue Button&reg; is a registered mark of HHS\n---\n (built Mon, Dec 23, 2019 19:40+0000+00:00)"

It has been updated to FHIR R4.0.1.\n\n**Introduction and Guidance**\n\nThis Implementation Guide (IG) contains profiles to implement support for Occupational Data for Health (ODH). ODH describes structured work information primarily designed to facilitate clinical care, including population health and value-based care. ODH also can be used to support public health reporting. ODH is not designed to support billing activities. \nThis set of FHIR profiles is specified as a composition resource, but it is not intended to be used as a stand-alone composition. Rather, the desired content should be included in broader IGs and available as a response to requests for ODH information. Some use cases may leverage only a subset of the ODH profiles, and these should be specified within those work products. For instance, in the Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) IG, the data requirements for work information are limited to  those in the Usual Work profile.\nWhile this profile is specified for the US Realm, the design is intended to also support international needs. Three of the referenced value sets?Occupation, Industry, and Supervisory Level? are necessarily US specific. The remaining three value sets?Work Schedule, Employment Status, and Work Classification?use international concepts. Input is requested regarding whether these should be specified as ?extensible?, ?required? (using ?text only? where a concept does not yet exist such as a new occupation), or as an ?example? for those US specific concepts.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe majority of adults in the U.S. spend more than half their waking hours at work. Therefore, health and work are inextricably inter-related. For example, the management of chronic conditions requires taking the patient?s work environment into consideration. Work-related conditions are often first brought to the attention of a primary care provider. Some conditions related to exposure to hazards in the workplace can have a long latency, requiring knowledge of a person?s work history for recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. The recognition of new conditions related to previously unknown workplace hazards has often come from astute clinicians, which requires knowledge of the patient?s work. ONC has indicated recognition of the value of work information for health care.\nThe incorporation of ODH into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and other health IT systems presents an opportunity to improve health in relation to work. ODH provides a structure and standardization for work information that can be used across systems to take advantage of system tools for clinical decision support, population health, and public health. Research has been conducted and guidance is available to support clinicians, and the use of ODH by health IT systems can support identification of patients that would benefit the most from this knowledge.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe Occupational Data for Health (ODH) FHIR IG covers information about a patient?s work, including some voluntary work, or a patient?s household members? work. ODH is designed for the social history section of a medical record, to facilitate clinical care in multiple disciplines and delivery environments. ODH can be used for clinical decision support, population health activities and value-based care, and public health reporting. The scope of the work information in ODH includes:\n\n? Employment Status\n\n? Retirement Date\n\n? Combat Zone Period\n\n? Past or Present Job for the patient or a household member, which includes:\n  \n  o Past or Present Job Occupation\n  \n  o Past or Present Job Industry\n  \n  o Work Classification\n  \n  o Work Schedule, which includes:\n    \n    - Weekly Work Days\n    \n    - Daily Work Hours\n  \n  o Job Duty\n  \n  o Occupational Hazard\n  \n  o Employer name\n  \n  o Employer address\n  \n  o Related Subject (when it is Past or Present Job of a household member of the person)\n  \n  o Start/End Dates\n\n? Usual Work of the patient or a household member, which includes:\n  \n  o Usual Occupation\n  \n  o Usual Industry\n  \n  o Usual Occupation Duration\n  \n  o Related Subject (when it is Usual Work of a household member of the person)\n  \n  o Start Date\n\n**Known Issues and Limitations**\n\nThis IG includes more extensive occupational data than typically collected in current systems. The content and structure of this IG is intended to inform clinical care, support population health, and contribute to public health activities. While there may be some overlap with administrative and billing information maintained by some systems, the information in this IG is not designed to support billing and administrative needs.\nWhile multiple retirement dates are supported, the retirement date is not linked to any specific job, or usual occupation.\n\n**Credits**\n\nCo-Editor:\nLori Reed-Fourquet\ne-HealthSign, LLC\nlfourquet@ehealthsign.com\n\nCo-Editor:\nRob Hausam\nHausam Consulting\nrob@hausamconsulting.com\n\nCo-Editor:\nMark Kramer\nMITRE Corporation\nmkramer@mitre.org\n\nThis set of FHIR profiles was produced and developed through the efforts of a project of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the U.S. federal agency responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. NIOSH is a part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NIOSH consulted stakeholders in clinical care, public health, health IT, health informatics and  U.S. government agencies to develop ODH. The HL7� Public Health and Emergency Response Work Group sponsored development of this set of FHIR profiles. Co-sponsoring HL7� Work Groups were Orders and Observations (OO), Patient Administration (PA), and Clinical Quality Initiative (CQI).\nThe following individuals provided subject matter expertise for this set of FHIR profiles: Genevieve Barkocy Luensman, NIOSH; Eileen Storey, Professional Services Partners, formerly NIOSH; Margaret S. Filios, NIOSH; Christina Socias-Morales, NIOSH; Lauren Brewer, NIOSH; Barbara Wallace, Professional Services Partners.\n\n**Authors**\n\nName Email/URL\nHL7 International - Public Health http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/pher (built Mon, Mar 27, 2023 09:54+1100+11:00)",

It has been updated to FHIR R4.0.1.\n\n**Introduction and Guidance**\n\nThis Implementation Guide (IG) contains profiles to implement support for Occupational Data for Health (ODH). ODH describes structured work information primarily designed to facilitate clinical care, including population health and value-based care. ODH also can be used to support public health reporting. ODH is not designed to support billing activities. \nThis set of FHIR profiles is specified as a composition resource, but it is not intended to be used as a stand-alone composition. Rather, the desired content should be included in broader IGs and available as a response to requests for ODH information. Some use cases may leverage only a subset of the ODH profiles, and these should be specified within those work products. For instance, in the Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) IG, the data requirements for work information are limited to  those in the Usual Work profile.\nWhile this profile is specified for the US Realm, the design is intended to also support international needs. Three of the referenced value sets?Occupation, Industry, and Supervisory Level? are necessarily US specific. The remaining three value sets?Work Schedule, Employment Status, and Work Classification?use international concepts. Input is requested regarding whether these should be specified as ?extensible?, ?required? (using ?text only? where a concept does not yet exist such as a new occupation), or as an ?example? for those US specific concepts.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe majority of adults in the U.S. spend more than half their waking hours at work. Therefore, health and work are inextricably inter-related. For example, the management of chronic conditions requires taking the patient?s work environment into consideration. Work-related conditions are often first brought to the attention of a primary care provider. Some conditions related to exposure to hazards in the workplace can have a long latency, requiring knowledge of a person?s work history for recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. The recognition of new conditions related to previously unknown workplace hazards has often come from astute clinicians, which requires knowledge of the patient?s work. ONC has indicated recognition of the value of work information for health care.\nThe incorporation of ODH into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and other health IT systems presents an opportunity to improve health in relation to work. ODH provides a structure and standardization for work information that can be used across systems to take advantage of system tools for clinical decision support, population health, and public health. Research has been conducted and guidance is available to support clinicians, and the use of ODH by health IT systems can support identification of patients that would benefit the most from this knowledge.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe Occupational Data for Health (ODH) FHIR IG covers information about a patient?s work, including some voluntary work, or a patient?s household members? work.

The goal is to identify, document and constrain  specific exchange patterns so that providers and payers can reliably exchange information for patient care (including coordination of care), risk adjustment, quality reporting, identifying that requested services are necessary and appropriate (e.g. should be covered by the payer) and other uses that may be documented as part of this effort. Clinical data payloads will include C-CDA, C-CDA on FHIR, compositions, bundles, and discrete resources conforming to the US Core specification. \n\nUltimately this IG is expected to support multiple versions of FHIR (DSTU2/Argonaught, STU3, and R4), but the current version of this IG only supports for FHIR R4. \n\nThe implementation guide is organized into the following major sections:\n\n* **[Introduction](Introduction.html)**: describes the HL7 FHIR standard, and explains the content covered in this implementation guide (IG) and how it is organized to help payers understand how to access and use the specification. It also identifies other supporting specifications that are utilized to address the use cases covered in this IG.\n* **[Use Cases, Personas and Patient Story](Use_Cases,_Personas_and_Patient_Story.html)**: describes specific information exchange scenarios that are covered by the CDex IG and demonstrates steps and information exchange mechanisms employed to accomplish the data exchange required for each use case. Each use case includes one or more variants to demonstrate different exchange interactions that may be used to accomplish the information sharing objective of the use case.  Each use case variant defines the technical roles (actors) played by systems involved in the information exchange, explains the steps involved with any preconditions or post conditions defined, and provides a sequence diagram illustration to show the flow of information in the exchange. \n* **[CDex Profiles and Extensions](CDex_Profiles_and_Extensions.html)**: introduces and provides links to the supported profiles, search parameters and other FHIR artifacts used in this implementation guide as well as in the [Health Record Exchange IG](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/). It provides the technical conformance details for profiles that are defined within and used only by the CDex IG. \n* **[Information Exchange Interactions and Specifications](Information_Exchange_Interactions_and_Specifications.html)**: describes how each information exchange interaction is implemented in FHIR. Readers will be directed to reference documentation in the HRex IG for  information about interactions fully defined in that guide. \n* **[Credits](Credits.html)**: identifies the individuals and organizations involved in developing this implementation guide\n\n\n\n (built Thu, Jun 20, 2019 16:38-0400-04:00)"

What is unique about this guide is that is provides additional technical guidance on two FHIR transaction approaches for requesting information:\n\n - Direct Query\n - Task Based Approach:\n\nThe types of clinical data is not limited to FHIR resources, but includes C-CDA documents, pdfs, text files and other types of data. There may be requests for payloads of clinical records of care such as CCD Documents, clinical data sets that may be represented in a FHIR bundles, and clinical data such as a specific FHIR resource. By using the FHIR standard and implementing this guide the quality of information shared can be improved.   Payers can be explicit about the data they are requesting, as opposed to general requests which often result in providers sending more information than might be necessary to make sure claims are supported.

Test results provide value to both the individual taking the tests and also to public health authorities responsible for coordinating a regional and national response. Digital platforms are being developed that allow individual test results, with permission of the individual, to be captured, organized, and transmitted to public health systems. Test manufacturers, working in partnership with these digital platforms, are seeking guidance on how to send test results. With multiple tests already entering the market, there is a need for a unified strategy on data flow of test results from the apps to downstream systems. A national data exchange standard should be supported that guides data exchange from test results residing on individual users? digital test applications to public health authorities, at both the federal and regional levels.  \n\n### Introduction\nThis implementation guide (IG) constrains the FHIR [US Core Diagnostic Report for Laboratory Results](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-lab) and the  [US Core Laboratory Observation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-observation-lab) for use in transmitting At-Home In-Vitro Test results to local, state, territorial and federal health agencies. The IG will be be used in real world testing. It was developed as part of a collaborative project with the NIH/NIBIB, ONC, a vendor manufacturer of diagnostic healthcare products that makes one of the FDA approved At-Home In-Vitro Test kits, and an app developer who is a leading provider of secure interoperability solutions. The intention of this guide is to assist developers in producing and sending standardized FHIR test result data from tests perfomed at home. FHIR eases app development and the FHIR US Core IG is in a rapid adoption curve. This guide points to already existing US Core Guidance and other guidance with respect to FHIR Parameters, FHIR operations, and RESTful and SMART on FHIR information.\n\nDue to Public Health Departments' familiarity with V2, a test implementation project related to this implementation guide will initially send COVID-19 At-Home In-Vitro Test Reports as V2 lab messages. Longer term the intent is to leverage FHIR for app creativity, growth, and interoperability. For as long as needed to comply with Public Health Department dependecies on V2, the apps will be designed to transform from FHIR to V2. In addition, as a parallel effort, a V2 <-> FHIR data mapping table has been developed [In-Vitro At-Home Test V2 FHIR Mapping.xlsx].\n\n**Please note** : This guide is a framework for future work. It contains \"framework\" profiles that contain constraints common to all At-Home In-Vitro Test Reporting use cases. These framework profiles can be further constrained to a particular use case such as the COVID-19 At-Home In-Vitro Test Reporting use case.

        "description": "Consolidated CDA (C-CDA) is one of the most widely implemented implementation guides for CDA and covers a significant scope of clinical care. Its target of the 'common/essential' elements of healthcare is closely aligned with FHIR's focus on the '80%'. There is significant interest in industry and government in the ability to interoperate between CDA and FHIR and C-CDA is a logical starting point. Implementers and regulators have both expressed an interest in the ability to map between FHIR and C-CDA.\n\nThis Implementation Guide (IG) defines a series of FHIR profiles on the Composition resource to represent the various document types in C-CDA. This release does not directly map every C-CDA template to FHIR profiles, rather tries to accomplish the C-CDA use case using Composition resource profiles created under this project (the equivalent of Level 2 CDA documents), and begins by linking to the profiles created under the US Core project for any coded entries that would normally be included in C-CDA sections. To have a simpler, more streamlined standard that reuses existing work and focuses on the 80% that implementers actually need in production systems, the resources of US Core represents a portion of the 80% needed for coded entries for coded entries of CCD, Care Plan & Discharge Summary).\n\nThe Composition profiles in this IG do not require coded data in any section. This is a departure from C-CDA, which requires coded data for Problems, Results, Medications, etc. This departure is intentional, as the C-CDA requirement for one or more coded entries in these sections resulted in some very complicated workarounds using nullFlavors to handle the fact that sometimes a patient is not on any medications, or has no current problems. In general, FHIR takes the approach that if something is nullable, it should simply be optional to ease the burden on implementers, thus C-CDA on FHIR does not require any coded entries, but rather uses the \"required if known\" approach, meaning that if an implementer's system has data for a section that requires data under Meaningful Use, they need to send it, but if they have no data there is no need for a null entry.\n\nWe encourage feedback on these Composition profiles, and the general approach to the project as a whole. We also encourage implementers who wish to see more of the coded data from C-CDA mapped to FHIR to comment on the US Core project and make their requests known there. Once US Core creates new profiles, this project can reference them.\n\n## Scope\n\nTo represent Consolidated CDA Templates for Clinical Notes (C-CDA) 2.1 templates using FHIR profiles.\n\nThis first stage of the project defines all the C-CDA document-level profiles on the Composition resource and contained sections.\n\nAny coded data used by sections will be represented using relevant U.S. Core FHIR profiles where they exist. FHIR profiles defined by other work groups or unconstrained FHIR resources may also be referenced if no appropriate US Core Profile exist.\n\nFor further information see the C-CDA specification here: http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=408.\n\n (built Wed, Oct 21, 2020 22:01+0000+00:00)"

    "description": "This implementation guide (IG) specifies standards for electronic submission of Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF) reports to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This IG contains a library of FHIR profiles for electronic submission of HAI LTCF reports to the NHSN.\n\nAs reports are modified and new report types are defined, CDC and Health Level Seven (HL7) will develop and publish additional constraints.\n\nThroughout this process, CDC remains the authority on NHSN data collection protocols. When healthcare enterprises choose to participate in NHSN, they must report to CDC reportable events such as identified MDRO (multidrug-resistant organism) or CDI (C. difficile infection) occurrences such as specific reportable procedures, even those without complications, and events such as a bloodstream infection, either confirmed by a positive blood culture or supported by a patients clinical symptoms. This specification opens the channel for data submission by all applications compliant with the data coding requirements defined here.\n\nNote that participation in the NHSN requires enrollment and filing of reporting plans, which are not defined by this specification. For an overview of NHSN and full information on NHSN participation requirements, see: [http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn](http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn). Provisions of the Public Health Service Act protect all data reported to NHSN from discovery through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n\n### Relationship to Another Standard\n\nHL7 has developed this FHIR implementation guide in parallel with the CDA implementation guide. We anticipate several STU releases on the path to a Normative Release 1 of the HL7 implementation guides for CDA and FHIR for Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Reports from Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF). The FHIR and CDA implementation guides will align. A change to one standard will require the same change in the other standard. \n\nIn this release, the new forms included in both the CDA and FHIR standards are:\n* **NHSN HAI LTCF Population Summary Report**: MDRO and CDI LabID Event Reporting Monthly Summary Data for LTCF\n* **NHSN HAI LTCF Single-Person Event Report**: Laboratory-identified MDRO or CDI Event for LTCF\n\nFor further details see the [NHSN website](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/) for reporting healthcare-associated infections in long-term care facilities.\n\n\n### Audience\n\nThe audience for this work is all developers of software systems who want to enable their systems for reporting HAI data to the NHSN.\n\n### Change Notification Process\n\nCDC maintains an e-mail list of contacts at organizations interested in or responsible for implementations of FHIR for LTCF HAI reporting to NHSN. To be added to the list, send a request with your contact information to nhsncda@cdc.gov. CDC uses the list for e-mail notifications of changes, including new data requirements. Changes may apply to this IG and to other documents such as business rules that are needed to implement and support FHIR for LTCF HAI reporting to NHSN. NHSN CDA related information may be found at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/index.html.  \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis implementation guide was produced and developed by Lantana Consulting Group in conjunction with the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Its development and deployment are results of the dedication of the team?led by Daniel A.

We anticipate several STU releases on the path to a Normative Release 1 of the HL7 implementation guides for CDA and FHIR for Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Reports from Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF). The FHIR and CDA implementation guides will align. A change to one standard will require the same change in the other standard. \n\nIn this release, the new forms included in both the CDA and FHIR standards are:\n* **NHSN HAI LTCF Population Summary Report**: MDRO and CDI LabID Event Reporting Monthly Summary Data for LTCF\n* **NHSN HAI LTCF Single-Person Event Report**: Laboratory-identified MDRO or CDI Event for LTCF\n\nFor further details see the [NHSN website](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/) for reporting healthcare-associated infections in long-term care facilities.\n\n\n### Audience\n\nThe audience for this work is all developers of software systems who want to enable their systems for reporting HAI data to the NHSN.\n\n### Change Notification Process\n\nCDC maintains an e-mail list of contacts at organizations interested in or responsible for implementations of FHIR for LTCF HAI reporting to NHSN. To be added to the list, send a request with your contact information to nhsncda@cdc.gov. CDC uses the list for e-mail notifications of changes, including new data requirements. Changes may apply to this IG and to other documents such as business rules that are needed to implement and support FHIR for LTCF HAI reporting to NHSN. NHSN CDA related information may be found at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/index.html.  \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis implementation guide was produced and developed by Lantana Consulting Group in conjunction with the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Its development and deployment are results of the dedication of the team?led by Daniel A.

The Argonaut pilot implementations, ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), and ONC U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v1 provided the requirements for this guide. The prior Argonaut search and vocabulary requirements, based on FHIR DSTU2, are updated in this guide to support FHIR Version R4.

When sending to a central registry, the FHIR Messaging paradigm shall be required; however when sending between LIS and EHR systems, implementors may choose to use alterantive transport and processing modalities, such as FHIR transaciton bundles. This publication provides the data model, defined data items and their corresponding code and value sets specific to a cancer pathology synoptic report. This guide contains a library of FHIR profiles to create a cancer pathology message bundle and is compliant with FHIR Release 4. (built Tue, Jul 11, 2023 15:47+0000+00:00)"

    "description": "### Introduction\nThis HL7&reg; Multiple Chronic Condition (MCC) Care Plan Implementation Guide (IG) defines FHIR R4 profiles, structures, extensions, transactions and value sets needed to represent, query for, and exchange Care Plan information. It defines how to represent coded content used to support the care planning activities focusing on the needs of patients with multiple chronic conditions. This initial version focuses on Chronic Kidney Disease Type 2 diabetes mellitus, common cardiovascular disease (hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart failure), chronic pain and Long Covid.The profiles defined within this IG were based on data elements of importance identified by the National Institute of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease technical expert panels.\n\nA Care Plan is a consensus-driven dynamic plan that represents a patient?s and Care Team Members? prioritized concerns, goals, planned and actual interventions and the resultant care outcomes. It serves as a blueprint shared by all Care Team Members (including the patient, their caregivers, and providers), to guide the patient?s care. A Care Plan integrates multiple interventions proposed by multiple providers and disciplines for multiple conditions. A Care Plan may represent one or more Care Plans and serves to reconcile and resolve conflicts between the various plans developed for a specific patient by different providers. It supports the following use cases:\n \n1.         Query for patient data across providers and compile into a consolidated care plan representation.\n2.         Encourage capture of and communication of a patient's health concerns and related goals, interventions, and outcomes.\n3.         Gather and aggregate patient data for uses beyond the point of care (e.g. public health, population health, quality measurement, risk adjustment, quality improvement, and research.)\n\nThis FHIR IG addresses the needs of multiple audiences. It provides technical artifacts that assist programmers when implementing standards-based FHIR application program interfaces (APIs) for specific purposes. It provides instructive material that explains how FHIR is used to accomplish specific use cases. It also provides general information that helps business analysts and technology decision-makers understand the use cases and benefits associated with achieving specific data exchange capabilities. A FHIR IG is as much a business planning tool as it is an educational resource and a technical specification.\n\n### How to Read this Guide and Cautions\nThis Guide is divided into several pages which are listed in the navigation bar at the top each page. The contents of each page are listed in a yellow \"Contents\" box at the top right of each page.\n\n### Value Set Library\n\nRather than creating nearly 1000 profiles covering important concepts for chronic care coordination for use within the MCC FHIR Care Plan profile, we have created 21 foundation profiles which conform to US Core Profiles (where available) adding constraints or extensions pertinent to their representation within a dynamic FHIR care plan and then creating libraries of value sets pertinent to the base profiles for representing chronic conditions, and their related interventions and goals and outcomes. \nThis project has built and houses its value sets in the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Value Set Authority Center (VSAC). The value sets are not directly bound within the foundation profiles, but value set library pages are provided with links to the value sets in VSAC and descriptions of where within the profile each value set may be used. Because the value sets are housed in VSAC, it is necessary for implementation sites to obtain a free (for the US) UMLS license. In addition, HL7 FHIR Policies requiring everything to be open source in all realms, may present some implementation validation issues when interfacing with a value set housed in VSAC. This IG will provide guidance for this issue.\n\n### History of the Care Plan and Electronic Care Plans\n\nThe concept of a care plan began as a teaching tool for nursing students to research and document the medical conditions their patients had and identify the associated nursing care and family support needed. This was documented in a structured paper format that fostered the nursing process. The nursing process is the identification of health concerns and related goals, and the interventions needed to meet those goals and then evaluating the meeting of those goals ? the outcomes. Over the years, the care plan evolved from a student teaching tool to something required for most patients in some format by various regulating or certifying bodies, and further, from a nursing care based plan, to an interdisciplinary patient focused tool.\n\nMost major vendors have electronic Care Plan modules, but the degree to which the modules are implemented and actively used is unknown. Few, if any, are exchange standards ready or mapped to exchange standards. The first HL7 standard representing Care Plan was the C-CDA Care Plan document designed to represent an instance of an EHR Care Plan similar to the Continuity of Care (CCD) CDA. Many of the learnings and designs for the FHIR Care Plan Resource and this IG were derived from the C-CDA Care Plan. There is also an IHE [Dynamic Care Planning (DCP)](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Dynamic_Care_Planning_(DCP)) that provides the structures and transactions for care planning, creating, updating and sharing Care Plans that meet the needs of many, such as providers, patients and payers..  The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) has put into regulation requirements around goals and health concerns which can currently be met by free text. The Dynamic Care Planning (DCP) Profile provides leveraged FHIR Resources to provide the structures and transactions for care planning and sharing Care Plans that meet the needs of many, such as providers, patients and payers. The DCP profile leverages the FHIR Care Plan resource, but does not specify, describe or define the use of it for representing specific conditions or multiple conditions. We are unaware of any real world implementations of it at this time.\n\nWe believe that this IG will be the first fully defined HL7 FHIR IG leveraging the FHIR Care Plan resources as its backbone structure for representing a dynamic care plan and testing its ability to bring together aggregated patient care plan data including patient outcomes.\n\n### Project Overview\n\nMore than 25 percent of Americans have MCC, accounting for more than 65 percent of U.S. healthcare spending. These individuals have complex health needs handled by diverse providers, across multiple settings of care. As a result, their care is often fragmented, poorly coordinated, and inefficient. Therefore, data aggregation is particularly important and challenging for people with MCC. These challenges will increasingly strain the U.S. health system, with the aging of the U.S. population. Projections suggest numbers of adults aged 65 and older will more than double and numbers of those aged 85 and older will triple by 2050.\n \nCare plans are a prominent part of multifaceted, care coordination interventions that reduce mortality and hospitalizations and improve disease management and satisfaction. In addition, proactive care planning promotes person-centeredness, improves outcomes, and reduces the cost of care. By design, care plans take a patient-centered approach, both by making comprehensive health data available across providers and settings and through the incorporation of data elements that have not traditionally been included in health IT systems (e.g., social determinants of health SDOH, patient health and life goals, patient preferences). While Care Plans have been developed, they remain paper-based in many U.S. healthcare settings and are not standardized and interoperable across care settings when electronic. While care plans focused on a single disease or condition are unlikely to be tenable for patients with MCC or their providers, existing care plans infrequently address individuals with MCC. The development of care plans based on structured data has been proposed as a method for enabling electronic systems to pull together and share data elements automatically and dynamically. Such aggregated data would not only provide actionable information to identify and achieve health and wellness goals for individuals with MCC, but also would reduce missingness and improve quality of point-of-care data for use in pragmatic research.\n \nThe Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification is an open-source standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically based on emerging industry approaches. The FHIR workflow specification includes a CarePlan request resource that may facilitate transfer of data for an e-care plan across healthcare settings. SMART (https://smarthealthit.org/) and SMART on FHIR standards include open specifications to integrate applications with health IT systems and may enable the development of an e-care plan application that can integrate with a variety of electronic health record (EHR) systems.\n\nInitiated by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the multiple chronic conditions (MCC) electronic care (eCare) Plan Project aims to develop, test, and pilot an interoperable eCare plan that will facilitate aggregation and sharing of critical patient-centered data across home, community, clinic, and research-based settings for persons with MCC, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), pain with opioid use disorder (OUD), and long COVID. \n\nThe HL7-based activities of the MCC eCare Plan Project include:\n \n - Identified use cases to support the documentation and exchange of MCC eCare plan data within EHRs and related systems.\n - Identified, developed, and prioritized the necessary MCC data elements and clinical terminology standards and FHIR� mappings that will enable the standardized transfer of data across health settings.\n - Develop, test, and ballot an HL7� Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR�) Implementation Guide based on the defined use cases and MCC data elements.\n \nNon-HL7 related activities of the MCC eCare Plan project will be facilitated through the [AHRQ eCare Plan Project Confluence](https://ecareplan.ahrq.gov/collaborate):\n - The project includes the develoment and testing of an open-source clinician and patient facing SMART-on-FHIR eCare plan application for managing persons with MCC.\n\n####  Project Timelines\n - January 2024: A For comment ballot to gather community input prior to the formal STU Ballot\n - September 2024: Formal STU Ballot\n - May 2025 Formal HL7 Publication\n\n\n### Guidance\nThe guidance section provides general implementation guidance and best practices. It describes the relation to and reuse of the US Core Implementation Guide profiles and reuse of its conformance requirements and expectations for the servers and client applications. Vocabulary use and value set binding heuristics are described.\n\n####  Relationship to US Core\n\nThis Implementation Guide reuses US Core profiles either through direct use or by constraining select profiles for representation within a FHIR Care Plan profile. Where US Core does not have a profile or function that is needed for the use cases or data elements, the IG constrains or directly reuses other resources, or profiles defined in other FHIR IGs. \nThis guide will reuse the US Core Care Plan. However, the required US Core CarePlan.text and the required Care.Plan.category:AssessPlan may be limiting factors for this context of use: aggregation of multiple chronic condition care plans and the ability to query for structured data within a structured Care Plan. As such, we recommend adding additional Care Plan categories if deemed more informational to reflect multiple chronic condition care coordination and plans and to hard code ?Multiple Chronic Condition Care Coordination Plan? at CarePlan.text\n\n\n#####  General US Core IG Conformance\n\nThis guide will adhere to or build on US conformance requirements, most of its [General Guidance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html), and its [Capability Statements](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/capstatements.html) where applicable. \n\n#####  Provenance\n\nThis IG recommends implementers adhere to guidelines and definitions provided in US Core?s [Basic Provenance Guidance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/basic-provenance.html). \n\n#####  Must Support\n\nThis IG will adhere to the US Core [Must Support](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#must-support) concept and rules.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThis Implementation Guide was made possible through the visionary leadership of the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) ](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/)and the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) ](https://www.ahrq.gov/)with funding from the [Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)](https://aspe.hhs.gov/collaborations-committees-advisory-groups/os-pcortf/explore-portfolio).

        "description": "### Introduction\nThis HL7&reg; Multiple Chronic Condition (MCC) Care Plan Implementation Guide (IG) defines FHIR R4 profiles, structures, extensions, transactions and value sets needed to represent, query for, and exchange Care Plan information. It defines how to represent coded content used to support the care planning activities focusing on the needs of patients with multiple chronic conditions. This initial version focuses on Chronic Kidney Disease Type 2 diabetes mellitus, common cardiovascular disease (hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart failure), chronic pain and Long Covid.The profiles defined within this IG were based on data elements of importance identified by the National Institute of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease technical expert panels.\n\nA Care Plan is a consensus-driven dynamic plan that represents a patient?s and Care Team Members? prioritized concerns, goals, planned and actual interventions and the resultant care outcomes. It serves as a blueprint shared by all Care Team Members (including the patient, their caregivers, and providers), to guide the patient?s care. A Care Plan integrates multiple interventions proposed by multiple providers and disciplines for multiple conditions. A Care Plan may represent one or more Care Plans and serves to reconcile and resolve conflicts between the various plans developed for a specific patient by different providers. It supports the following use cases:\n \n1.         Query for patient data across providers and compile into a consolidated care plan representation.\n2.         Encourage capture of and communication of a patient's health concerns and related goals, interventions, and outcomes.\n3.         Gather and aggregate patient data for uses beyond the point of care (e.g. public health, population health, quality measurement, risk adjustment, quality improvement, and research.)\n\nThis FHIR IG addresses the needs of multiple audiences. It provides technical artifacts that assist programmers when implementing standards-based FHIR application program interfaces (APIs) for specific purposes. It provides instructive material that explains how FHIR is used to accomplish specific use cases. It also provides general information that helps business analysts and technology decision-makers understand the use cases and benefits associated with achieving specific data exchange capabilities. A FHIR IG is as much a business planning tool as it is an educational resource and a technical specification.\n\n### How to Read this Guide and Cautions\nThis Guide is divided into several pages which are listed in the navigation bar at the top each page. The contents of each page are listed in a yellow \"Contents\" box at the top right of each page.\n\n### Value Set Library\n\nRather than creating nearly 1000 profiles covering important concepts for chronic care coordination for use within the MCC FHIR Care Plan profile, we have created 21 foundation profiles which conform to US Core Profiles (where available) adding constraints or extensions pertinent to their representation within a dynamic FHIR care plan and then creating libraries of value sets pertinent to the base profiles for representing chronic conditions, and their related interventions and goals and outcomes. \nThis project has built and houses its value sets in the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Value Set Authority Center (VSAC). The value sets are not directly bound within the foundation profiles, but value set library pages are provided with links to the value sets in VSAC and descriptions of where within the profile each value set may be used. Because the value sets are housed in VSAC, it is necessary for implementation sites to obtain a free (for the US) UMLS license. In addition, HL7 FHIR Policies requiring everything to be open source in all realms, may present some implementation validation issues when interfacing with a value set housed in VSAC. This IG will provide guidance for this issue.\n\n### History of the Care Plan and Electronic Care Plans\n\nThe concept of a care plan began as a teaching tool for nursing students to research and document the medical conditions their patients had and identify the associated nursing care and family support needed. This was documented in a structured paper format that fostered the nursing process. The nursing process is the identification of health concerns and related goals, and the interventions needed to meet those goals and then evaluating the meeting of those goals ? the outcomes. Over the years, the care plan evolved from a student teaching tool to something required for most patients in some format by various regulating or certifying bodies, and further, from a nursing care based plan, to an interdisciplinary patient focused tool.\n\nMost major vendors have electronic Care Plan modules, but the degree to which the modules are implemented and actively used is unknown. Few, if any, are exchange standards ready or mapped to exchange standards. The first HL7 standard representing Care Plan was the C-CDA Care Plan document designed to represent an instance of an EHR Care Plan similar to the Continuity of Care (CCD) CDA. Many of the learnings and designs for the FHIR Care Plan Resource and this IG were derived from the C-CDA Care Plan. There is also an IHE [Dynamic Care Planning (DCP)](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Dynamic_Care_Planning_(DCP)) that provides the structures and transactions for care planning, creating, updating and sharing Care Plans that meet the needs of many, such as providers, patients and payers..  The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) has put into regulation requirements around goals and health concerns which can currently be met by free text. The Dynamic Care Planning (DCP) Profile provides leveraged FHIR Resources to provide the structures and transactions for care planning and sharing Care Plans that meet the needs of many, such as providers, patients and payers. The DCP profile leverages the FHIR Care Plan resource, but does not specify, describe or define the use of it for representing specific conditions or multiple conditions. We are unaware of any real world implementations of it at this time.\n\nWe believe that this IG will be the first fully defined HL7 FHIR IG leveraging the FHIR Care Plan resources as its backbone structure for representing a dynamic care plan and testing its ability to bring together aggregated patient care plan data including patient outcomes.\n\n### Project Overview\n\nMore than 25 percent of Americans have MCC, accounting for more than 65 percent of U.S. healthcare spending. These individuals have complex health needs handled by diverse providers, across multiple settings of care. As a result, their care is often fragmented, poorly coordinated, and inefficient. Therefore, data aggregation is particularly important and challenging for people with MCC. These challenges will increasingly strain the U.S. health system, with the aging of the U.S. population. Projections suggest numbers of adults aged 65 and older will more than double and numbers of those aged 85 and older will triple by 2050.\n \nCare plans are a prominent part of multifaceted, care coordination interventions that reduce mortality and hospitalizations and improve disease management and satisfaction. In addition, proactive care planning promotes person-centeredness, improves outcomes, and reduces the cost of care. By design, care plans take a patient-centered approach, both by making comprehensive health data available across providers and settings and through the incorporation of data elements that have not traditionally been included in health IT systems (e.g., social determinants of health SDOH, patient health and life goals, patient preferences). While Care Plans have been developed, they remain paper-based in many U.S. healthcare settings and are not standardized and interoperable across care settings when electronic. While care plans focused on a single disease or condition are unlikely to be tenable for patients with MCC or their providers, existing care plans infrequently address individuals with MCC. The development of care plans based on structured data has been proposed as a method for enabling electronic systems to pull together and share data elements automatically and dynamically. Such aggregated data would not only provide actionable information to identify and achieve health and wellness goals for individuals with MCC, but also would reduce missingness and improve quality of point-of-care data for use in pragmatic research.\n \nThe Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification is an open-source standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically based on emerging industry approaches. The FHIR workflow specification includes a CarePlan request resource that may facilitate transfer of data for an e-care plan across healthcare settings. SMART (https://smarthealthit.org/) and SMART on FHIR standards include open specifications to integrate applications with health IT systems and may enable the development of an e-care plan application that can integrate with a variety of electronic health record (EHR) systems.\n\nInitiated by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the multiple chronic conditions (MCC) electronic care (eCare) Plan Project aims to develop, test, and pilot an interoperable eCare plan that will facilitate aggregation and sharing of critical patient-centered data across home, community, clinic, and research-based settings for persons with MCC, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), pain with opioid use disorder (OUD), and long COVID. \n\nThe HL7-based activities of the MCC eCare Plan Project include:\n \n - Identified use cases to support the documentation and exchange of MCC eCare plan data within EHRs and related systems.\n - Identified, developed, and prioritized the necessary MCC data elements and clinical terminology standards and FHIR� mappings that will enable the standardized transfer of data across health settings.\n - Develop, test, and ballot an HL7� Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR�) Implementation Guide based on the defined use cases and MCC data elements.\n \nNon-HL7 related activities of the MCC eCare Plan project will be facilitated through the [AHRQ eCare Plan Project Confluence](https://ecareplan.ahrq.gov/collaborate):\n - The project includes the develoment and testing of an open-source clinician and patient facing SMART-on-FHIR eCare plan application for managing persons with MCC.\n\n####  Project Timelines\n - January 2024: A For comment ballot to gather community input prior to the formal STU Ballot\n - September 2024: Formal STU Ballot\n - May 2025 Formal HL7 Publication\n\n\n### Guidance\nThe guidance section provides general implementation guidance and best practices. It describes the relation to and reuse of the US Core Implementation Guide profiles and reuse of its conformance requirements and expectations for the servers and client applications. Vocabulary use and value set binding heuristics are described.\n\n####  Relationship to US Core\n\nThis Implementation Guide reuses US Core profiles either through direct use or by constraining select profiles for representation within a FHIR Care Plan profile. Where US Core does not have a profile or function that is needed for the use cases or data elements, the IG constrains or directly reuses other resources, or profiles defined in other FHIR IGs. \nThis guide will reuse the US Core Care Plan. However, the required US Core CarePlan.text and the required Care.Plan.category:AssessPlan may be limiting factors for this context of use: aggregation of multiple chronic condition care plans and the ability to query for structured data within a structured Care Plan. As such, we recommend adding additional Care Plan categories if deemed more informational to reflect multiple chronic condition care coordination and plans and to hard code ?Multiple Chronic Condition Care Coordination Plan? at CarePlan.text\n\n\n#####  General US Core IG Conformance\n\nThis guide will adhere to or build on US conformance requirements, most of its [General Guidance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html), and its [Capability Statements](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/capstatements.html) where applicable. \n\n#####  Provenance\n\nThis IG recommends implementers adhere to guidelines and definitions provided in US Core?s [Basic Provenance Guidance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/basic-provenance.html). \n\n#####  Must Support\n\nThis IG will adhere to the US Core [Must Support](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#must-support) concept and rules.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThis Implementation Guide was made possible through the visionary leadership of the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) ](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/)and the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) ](https://www.ahrq.gov/)with funding from the [Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)](https://aspe.hhs.gov/collaborations-committees-advisory-groups/os-pcortf/explore-portfolio).

    "description": "### Intent The intent of this guide is to provide a profile on the FHIR AdverseEvent Resource suitable for Clinical Research.  ### Overview A single Adverse Event (AE) may need to be reported in multiple ways. Choosing the appropriate form of the reporting is dependent upon workflow patterns. In particular, the implementation guides for Clinical Care adverse events and Clinical Research adverse events provide important extensions, value-sets and examples for implementing AdverseEvent.  This guide, the Clinical Research adverse event implementation guide, is for the clinical research setting. In this setting, the event is tracked and evaluated as part of the clinical research process for the research study.  In the research setting an adverse event is the result of an intervention that caused unintentional harm to a specific subject or group of subjects (this is surfaced in the profile as a constraint of ?actual? for the value of ?actuality?). An example of an adverse event in the clinical research setting would be a patient develops renal failure while on a study drug. These events are characterized by the need to capture cause-and-effect (although they might not be known at the time of the event), severity, and outcome.  The context of an adverse event is also important, and captured in the AdverseEvent Clinical Research Profile data elements. A subject may have condition(s) or current treatments (medications, diet, devices) that impact their response to a newly introduced medication, device or procedure. Knowledge of these variables is essential in establishing a cause-and-effect relationship for an adverse event. This information is represented with corresponding resources (e.g. Procedure Resource for procedures, etc.) and referenced.  A potential adverse event may also be called a near miss or an error, these are not reported with the AdverseEvent Clinical Research Profile.  ### Scope This FHIR IG enables the collection of adverse events in real-world data (RWD) sources such as electronic health records (EHR) and personal health records (PHR) that occur during clinical trials. It ensures the appropriate AE representation required to support clinical research trials within a regulated environment. As the AEs are collected in RWD sources, the data can be transmitted via FHIR to clinical trial management systems, regulatory agencies, sponsors, and clinical research organizations for further processing and reporting.  In the pre-market clinical research setting, serious adverse events must be reported to the sponsor, clinical research organization, and regulatory agencies within a specific time frame for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review. By using this IG, a clinical investigator can document an AE in the EHR, it can be received by a secondary clinical trial management system for triage and then forwarded to the sponsor and regulatory agencies. Similarly, a patient on a clinical trial can record an adverse event in their PHR that is then shared with the clinical investigator and reported to the sponsor and regulatory agencies as necessary. In a post-market situation, a patient, provider, or manufacturer can record the adverse event in a system and then report it to the FDA as a FHIR based MedWatch form.  Within this guide are several examples. Every effort has been made to capture the most important details of the use of the AdverseEvent profile. However, some examples may provide only a stub to referenced resources (e.g. instances of Patient Resource will be referenced using logical ids but are not resolvable, implementation of Patient is left for other guidance and is not the subject of this guide). Connectathons are ideal opportunities to create, compare and consider the holistic implementation of all FHIR Resources. (built Fri, Jul 28, 2023 19:51+0000+00:00)",
